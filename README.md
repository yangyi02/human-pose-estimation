# Articulated Human Pose Estimation with Flexible Mixtures-of-Parts

## Introduction

This is a Matlab implementation of the human pose estimation algorithm described in [1]. It includes pre-trained full-body and upper-body models. Much of the detection code is built on top of part-based model implementation of [2]. The training code implements a quadratic program (QP) solver described in [3].

To illustrate the use of the training code, this package also uses positive images from the PARSE dataset [4], the BUFFY dataset [5], and negative images from the INRIA Person Background dataset [6]. We also include the PCP evaluation code from [5] for benchmark evaluation on both datasets. The original evaluation code assumes a rigid-template detector, and we make modifications for our deformable skeleton detector.

Compatibility issues: The training code requires 7.5GB of memory. Modify line 32/33 in `code_full/learning/train.m` to use less memory at the cost of longer training times.

Acknowledgements: We graciously thank the authors of the previous code releases and image benchmarks for making them publically available.

## Using the detection code

1. Move to the code_basic directory
2. Start matlab
3. Run the 'compile' script to compile the helper functions.
   (you may need to edit compile.m to use a different convolution 
    routine depending on your system)
4. Run 'demo' to see an example of the code run on sample images.
5. By default, the code is set to output the highest-scoring detection
   in an image. Uncomment line 27 if you would like to see all detections.

## Using the learning code

1. Move to the code_full directory
2. Start matlab
3. Run the 'compile' script to compile the helper functions.
   (you may need to edit compile.m to use a different convolution 
    routine depending on your system)
4. Run 'PARSE_demo' or 'BUFFY_demo' to see an example of the complete system, including training and benchmark evaluation.
